# TASKS of NESTED FOR LOOP
# Task # 1 : Write a program that prints a square pattern using nested for loops.
# The program should prompt the user for the side length of the square.
# Task # 2 :Write a program that prints the multiplication table of numbers from 1 to 10 using nested for loops.
# Task # 3 :Write a program that prints a Triangle pattern using nested for loops.
# Task # 4 :Write a program that prints a Pyramid pattern using nested for loops.
# Task # 5 :Write a program that prints a diamond pattern using nested for loops.

# Task # 3 :Write a program that reverses a list of integers without using any built-in functions or methods.
# Task # 4 :Given a list of numbers, write a program to remove all the even numbers from the list and print the updated list.
# Task # 5 :Given a list of strings, create a new list containing only the strings that have more than 5 characters.
